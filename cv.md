I am a 4th year student of the Faculty of Physics of BSU. My specialty is computer physics, which implies modeling of physical processes, which can be very different. However, modeling requires not only a good knowledge of programming, algorithms and the process in particular, but also good imagination, perseverance and zeal.
Also, I am not an exception to the famous expression "Physicist-lyricist" - I am fascinated by literature, art and photography. I believe that this is not something separate from any accuracy and order, because even the driest programming and mathematics are art.

I work with programming languages and platforms such as: ะก++, Mathematica, MathCad, PHP, Vue.js, and now I'm learning to work with CSS and HTML

Unfortunately, my practice of English does not go beyond school and university study.

As with any physicist, my main goal is to study the world around me. For this, of course, you need to know the mathematics, which is the language of science. However, human "capacities" are not enough for the voluminous calculations that science is now engaged in, whether it is molecular dynamics or quantum chemistry. Math alone is not enough today. Programming required. In this regard, every physicist needs to establish a relationship with a computer, start talking to him in his language.

My experience is in numerous laboratory work on modeling physical processes (mainly in C ++). Also, I learned to work on Vue.js and PHP myself.
